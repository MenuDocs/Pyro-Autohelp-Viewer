    This website aims to provide a simplistic way for
    users to receive automated code help in Menudocs, Nextcord and Disnake.
    <br><br>
    Pyro will automatically detect certain cases where the user's code
    is invalid and provide a reference for how they can fix the issue
    as well as explaining why what they did was wrong.
